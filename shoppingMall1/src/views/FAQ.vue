      Q: What is a pending paypal e-check, and why i need to wait for it clear ?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      A: A pending e-check is a type of payment option available with paypal. A
      pending e-check is just like writing a normal check, except
      electronically. Just like normal checks, pending e-checks take a few days
      to clear while paypal verifies that funds are present within the senders
      account. Once the check has cleared, the money is transferred to ssegold’s
      account and then delivery can take place immediately thereafter.
    </div>
    <div class="title">Q: How do i avoid sending an paypal e-check ?</div>
    <div class="content">
      A: An e-check results when a payment is sent from an unverified account
      without sufficient balance in the paypal account to cover the cost of the
      order. Paypal must contact the bank and verify that the funds are present,
      thus the cause of the 3 to 4 days delay. To avoid sending an e-check,
      first complete the verification process for your account, and then make
      sure the funds are present in paypal before you place an order. To confirm
      your payment type, just before placing the order you will see a blue
      hyperlink that reads: "choose more funding options". By clicking this link
      you may determine which option is currently selected for your payment, and
      what payment options your account supports.

      delivery any time. Refund will be made within 30mins.

    <div class="title">Q: How long it takes until i get my refund ?</div>
    <div class="content">
      A: If you pay by fund though paypal or skrill, the money will be shown up
      in your paypal / skrill account instantly after we refund at our end. If
      you pay by a credit card / debit card though paypal or skrill, after we

      up in your card or bank account.
