    <div class="title">Security</div>
    <div class="content">
      The Team protects the privacy and integrity of the information it collects

    </div>
    <div class="content">
      Although the Team follows the procedures set forth above to protect the
      Personal Information submitted to the Team, no method of transmission over
      the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while
      the Team strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
      Personal Information, the Team cannot guarantee its absolute security.
